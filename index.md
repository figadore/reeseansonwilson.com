## Hello

I'm a self-motivated backend/devops-focused coder, trained as an engineer, with ~15 years experience in the heavily regulated healthcare industry. I have a passion for improving "developer experience". I enjoy learning and staying up to date with the latest technologies, best practices and trends, especially in the areas of cloud-native architectures and automated everything. I've designed and developed multiple systems from the ground up, managed a small team, and collaborated across organizations to deliver highly customized solutions.

I spent the first several years of my software career as the sole developer for my projects, but I thrive in collaborative environments. I have gained and lost proficiency with a variety of languages and tools over time. My favorite to work with is currently Go, but I'm interested in learning Rust and a few others.

I've love creating high quality tools and solutions for people and problems.
